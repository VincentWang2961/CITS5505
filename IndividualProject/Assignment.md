The first assessment for CITS5505 is to do some research on best coding practices in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and present your unique research by creating a website implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using those same best practices of course!). Your website should allow visting web developers to indicate which coding practices the visitor thinks their own website uses and then provide some a summary to them. It should also contain a page that can act as your CV that presents yourself to the teaching team. Bootstrap and JQuery may be used, but customised CSS is required to give your site a distinctive feel. Use of images, other media and creative design is encouraged!

Concretely your website should consist of two pages:

1. Best practices page 
   - The page should display the list of best practices in some manner. Each best practice should come with a) a short explanation of why it is a good idea to do and b) a tickbox (or equivalent method) for a web-developer user to indicate that they think their own website fulfils that criteria.
   - This page should use local storage to remember which best practices the user has selected even after opening and closing the page.
   - The page should present a dynamic summary about how many best coding practices the user has indicated they have met. The exact format and what data is displayed is up to you
   - Near this summary you should clearly state a simple criteria for "success" (e.g. over 12/15 best practices met) and when the user has met that metric you should use an AJAX request to retrieve a random cute animal picture from a suitable public API (e.g. from a service listed in "Animals" section of https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and display it to the user as a reward!
2. Personalised CV page. 
   - The second page should give a brief biography of the author, including a picture. It should be presented as a curriculum vitae that introduces yourself and you could show to potential employers.
   - Use placeholders for personal information (e.g. phone number, references). The page is expected to use advanced HTML, CSS and JavaScript to promote yourself.
   - It should be about 500 words of content, but interactive examples, including AJAX, pictures, animations etc. are encouraged.
   - Finally at the bottom of this page, there should be a clearly marked section containing references to all the sources you used in preparation of your assignment, *including AI assistance*. See the UWA referencing guide for details on how references should be presented: https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/referencinguwa

###### Submission

Submit your work for this assignment by clicking on the title of this item - "Assignment". The submission should consist of a **single folder**compressed as a .zip file.

The folder should contain the HTML files, CSS files and JavaScript files, along with any other personalised resources such as images of yourself. It should not contain other external libraries or resources (e.g. Bootstrap, fonts), instead if they are needed your page should load them dynamically. Use relative links so anchor and image tags work on the assessors computer, and avoid large media files. The page should be tested in Chrome, Firefox and Edge or Safari browsers, and should pass HTML/CSS validation.

All code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) should be commented and formatted in a clear and consistent manner.
