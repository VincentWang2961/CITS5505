                    <p>Squeaks and greetings! I'm Chips, the intellectual mouse companion of Vincent Wang. Don't let my tiny paws fool you â€“ I've mastered the art of keyboard navigation and can code faster than you can say "cheese!"</p>
                    <p>With whiskers that can sense code bugs from miles away, I've been Vincent's secret debugging assistant for over 3 years (that's like 21 in mouse years!). I specialize in finding the tiniest errors that human eyes miss, and I'm particularly skilled at navigating through maze-like codebases.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not helping Vincent with his projects, you can find me creating intricate nests from discarded sticky notes, conducting scientific experiments on which cheese pairs best with different coding languages, or running on my ergonomic exercise wheel to maintain peak performance. My mission is to prove that even the smallest creatures can make a big impact in the tech world!</p>

                    <h3>Story of the project</h3>
                    <p>This project is my first project of web dev. After this project, I tried to learn web dev myself by some online resources, like some online public class, CS50 from Harvard and CS571 from University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. However it's a bit hard to learn web dev framework like React taught in the lectures without any experience manipulate original DOM. I do not really understand the fundamental of the DOM and have no idea how it works. So I dropped, and started to learn by reading documentation. What I mainly works on is mostly JS as one of my friend who is expert of front-end dev told me the most important part of front-end is about JS. Although I know something about JS, I have no idea how to start the project as there are so many things to do and I'm not sure which sequence doing the tasks is right. To solve this issue, I searched some other website like some blog or aboutme website to learn which part needs to be involved in the web page, and I also use generatic artifical intelligence to help me construct the whole CSS style as all the CSS style design by me is ugly. From a basic HTML framework of the website and a completed designed CSS style, I tried to have some JS script to accomplish some floating effects. In this stage, I also use AI to help me fix the bugs, however I found that the AI was not that useful sometimes, as it actually can not fix the bug even if I told them how the bug looks like. To solve this, one solution is that, use the console of the browser and see what exactly part the bug inside, and told these information to AI, then it could find and fix the bug. Another way is just delete all the related JS part, and ask AI to code this part. Sometimes it still exists as most tof he CSS part is generated by AI, so some conflicts might happen, it's super easy to fix but hard to find, especially using AI, it generally can not found the issues due to CSS style. After finished the entire part or mostly finished, I researched some resources to fill the best practice part with it's source, I also filled the resume part, as I'm just in semester 2 and have no experiences of working, I can hardly finish this part using my real information, to make it easy, I putted the images of my pet rat and made up a resume of my rat, which is funny I think.</p>
